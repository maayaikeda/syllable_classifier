# Syllable Classifier


## Objective:
In songbird research, researchers manipulate the brain to see if it effects the birds' singing behavior. However, analyzing different features of thousands of songs takes a long time. Here, I used deep learning to develop a classifier that segments and classify the elements (syllables) of songs.
After running this notebook, you will have:

*  A folder containing audio files of individual syllables
*  An png plot of a spectogram with predicted syllables labeled like the example below.
*  A CSV file with predicted syllable label, syllable duration, and start and end time. You can add code to extract other features such as pitch later.

Work flow:
Preparation:
1.  Filter audio file
2.  Segment files into syllables
3.  Label the files

Train the classifier:

4.  Train the classifier

Use the classifier:

5.  Run the model on new file to get syllable infomation.
